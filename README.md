# Control-Statement-in-Python

This repository contains Python programs designed to practice basic Python skills including loops, conditionals, user input, and basic algorithms. Below is an explanation of each exercise along with an example run to guide users.

Exercise 1: MonthNames.py
This program reads an integer value between 1 and 12 from the user and prints the corresponding month of the year.

Exercise 2: CinemaTicket.py
This program calculates the ticket price based on the user's age.

Exercise 3: BodyMassIndex.py
This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and gives a weight status based on the user's weight in kilograms and height in meters.

Exercise 4: GreatestNumber.py
This program prompts the user for 3 numbers and prints the greatest among them.

Exercise 5: Factorial.py
This program computes the factorial of a given number using a loop. The number is provided by the user.

Exercise 6: ReverseNumber.py
This program reverses the digits of an input number using a while loop.

Exercise 7: Multiples.py
This program takes a number from the user and prints its multiples within a certain range using a loop.

Exercise 8: EchoProgram.py
This program continuously reads input from the user and prints the input back. The loop breaks when the input is 'done'.

Exercise 9: FizzBuzz.py
This program prints numbers from 1 to 10, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

Exercise 10: NumberPattern.py
This program prints the following pattern:

5 4 3 2 1
4 3 2 1
3 2 1
2 1
1
